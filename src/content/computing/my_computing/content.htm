    I have three different computers, each running a different operating system. Let's start with Windows. It's a necessary evil that I have to keep around. I tried transitioning to Linux for gaming, but I found that gaming on Linux is still not quite there yet. Once support for Windows 10 ends, I'll migrate to Linux, as there will be no other option. Ideally, I'd love to use Linux on all my computers, but for certain tasks, Linux is still not ready. Well, I could use ARDUOR instead of ABLETON, but I kind of donâ€™t want to do that just yet!
</p>

<p>What I need from Linux:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Alternative to Photoshop Photomerge. My current scanner can scan only up to medium format film. To scan 4x5 negatives, I need to scan them in two steps, then merge the scans.</li>
    <li>Alternative to SoundID Reference (this has made my YAMAHA HS8 sound so much better, also almost eliminating room tone. My room really likes 124 Hz.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Disregarding gaming, this is the reason i can't linux everyday. I hope that will change soon.</p>
