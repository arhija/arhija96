<h4>4 Portions - 40 Minutes</h4> 
<p>A quick and cheap hearty meal.</p> 
<h4>Ingredients:</h4> 
<ul> 
    <li>450g Udon noodles</li> 
    <li>One head of broccoli</li> 
    <li>Fresh chili peppers</li> 
    <li>One large white onion</li> 
    <li>Half a clove of garlic</li> 
    <li>Soy sauce</li> <li>Honey</li> 
    <li>Dijon mustard</li> 
</ul> <h4>Preparation:</h4> 
<ol> 
    <li>Wash and cut the broccoli. Take a large pot with water and a bit of salt and wait for it to boil. Add the broccoli to it and cook until soft (3-4 minutes). While cutting the broccoli, there will be small particles left; add those to a frying pan.</li>
    <br> <li>Cut the large white onion and add it to a frying pan with some oil of your choosing. Cut 3 chili peppers into the smallest pieces possible and add them to the frying pan. When the onions are close to being ready, chop a couple of cloves of garlic and add them to the pan.</li><br>
     <li>By this time, the broccoli will be ready. Pour the water out.</li><br> <li>For the sauce, you will need soy sauce, honey, and Dijon mustard. Add all of the ingredients together in a bowl and mix them. (60% soy sauce, 20% honey, 20% Dijon mustard.)</li><br> <li>Start making the noodles. You can use any kind you want, but I prefer to use dried Udon noodles. Use 4 portion sizes.</li><br> <li>Add the broccoli to the pan with the onions, chili, and garlic. Keep it on low heat and add the sauce. We want to thicken it.</li><br> <li>When the noodles are done cooking, add them to the pan, mix everything together, and cook for a couple of minutes until all of the ingredients are well combined.</li><br> <li>Garnish with chopped fresh spring onions.</li><br> <li>Enjoy it with friends.</li><br> </ol> <p>Do the dishes.</p>
