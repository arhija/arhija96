<article><paragraph>   I have always liked nature. It was a place where I could relax. At the time of the pandemic, she was the only reason to leave the house. During the walks, I began to think of nature as a dark force. Thatâ€™s when my opinion of her changed. It is no longer some good thing that offers humanity all the necessary things, but it can also take them away. With the series, I wanted to show the eternity of nature and something hidden, horrible in it.</paragraph></article>
